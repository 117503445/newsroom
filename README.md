# Newsroom Theme

This a simple, minimalistic theme, which is inspired by [Apple's Newsroom page](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/). You won't find a single reference of monolithic libraries such as `jquery`, `bootstrap`, `bulma`.

All the templates herein use *grid css*, *flexbox* & *vanilla js*. You may,however, proceed and tweak everything as you wish.

## Features

* Blog
* Modern
* Responsive
* Deeplinks

### Deeplinks

For all content published using markdown, deeplinks will be added to the pages so that you can share with precision :smiley: Just   hover on a heading and the link button will pop. Click it to copy.

### Dark Mode

Today most operating systems & browsers support dark mode. Like twitter, which automatically turns into dark mode when the user chooses darkmode, this theme does the same thing.
